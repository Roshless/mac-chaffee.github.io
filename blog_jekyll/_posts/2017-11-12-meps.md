The world of web development is constantly changing. In an attempt to keep up,
I've been working on a project which uses (relatively) new technology like Redis,
React, Docker, GitLab CI, and other trendy stuff.

The project is called the MEPS metric, a self-help app that my dad came up with.

The idea is that you rate your mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual or social
health every day out of 10. You can also add comments and journal entries about the day.
Then, you are presented with interactive graphs of your data and tips on improving your
MEPS metric.
